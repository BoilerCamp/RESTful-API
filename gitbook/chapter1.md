# Cloud9 Setup

Cloud9 is a pretty awesome tool that lets us quickly set up a virtual linux machine for development. Cloud9 also comes pre-installed with a bunch of useful software. Best of all, it's free! 

Get started by visiting their [website](https://c9.io) and creating an account.

Next, you'll be given the option to create a new workspace. You should see a screen like the one [below](http://i.imgur.com/uJyUAyA.png). Name your workspace whatever you want, but make sure you set it to a **public** workspace. If you set it to private, it will cause problems down the road. You can pick from a few starter templates but we want to pick the **custom** template.

Once your environment is ready to go, you'll see a page like the one [below](http://i.imgur.com/ON2dw15.png). You can access your files on the left, and create new tabs using the + icons. You can click on the "preview" button at the top of the screen to open a preview of your running application (although right now you'll see an error page if you try).
